# DVWA Vulnerability Testing Progress

## Testing Progress Tracker

Below is my current progress in testing and documenting various vulnerabilities in DVWA:

### Completed

- [x] **Brute Force** - *Completed on 2025-04-03*
  - Used Hydra and Burp Suite across Low, Medium, and High levels.
  - Successfully identified credentials and bypassed CSRF tokens.
  - Created detailed documentation with screenshots.

- [x] **Command Injection** - *Completed on 2025-04-14*
  - Tested Low, Medium, and High security levels.
  - Bypassed blacklist filters using shell metacharacters (`|`).
  - Executed commands like `whoami`, `cat /etc/passwd`, `uname`, `printenv`.
  - Documented findings and mitigation strategies.

### In Progress

- [ ] **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** - *Started on 2025-04-21*
  - Completed low security level testing
  - Created a malicious HTML page with hidden form and auto-submit functionality
  - Successfully changed admin password through CSRF attack
  - Documentation with screenshots created
  - Need to test medium and high security levels
  - Need to explore more sophisticated attack vectors

### Not Started

- [ ] **SQL Injection**

- [ ] **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - Reflected XSS
  - Stored XSS
  - DOM-based XSS

- [ ] **File Inclusion**
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

- [ ] **File Upload**

- [ ] **Insecure CAPTCHA**

- [ ] **Weak Session IDs**

- [ ] **CSP Bypass**

## Testing Environment

- Host OS: macOS
- DVWA: Version 1.10 (latest) via Docker
- Testing Platform: Kali Linux on VMware
- Network Configuration: Bridged adapter

## Next Tasks

1. Complete CSRF testing for medium security level
   - Analyze referrer-based protection
   - Develop bypass techniques

2. Complete CSRF testing for high security level
   - Study anti-CSRF token implementation
   - Determine if any weaknesses exist

3. Document detailed mitigations for CSRF vulnerabilities
   - Focus on industry best practices
   - Include code examples
